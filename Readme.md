This project implements a STM32 based clone of remotes using encoding ICs AUT980202 or AUT1080425 ICs manufactured by ABOV.  These ICs are found in plug-in wireless remote outlets sold under the brand name Woods, model 32555WD, also Fuji Spray model 3072, probably others.

I will be publishing an instructable with more details about the code and an implementation example.
